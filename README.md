## Collatz Castle Text Adventure

a text adventure made from the maze that is the Collatz conjecture 

It is a work in progress at the moment.

You are randomly placed in somewhere along the tree of the Collatz numbers

you must use 3n + 1 to find your way back to 1.

I got the idea from a Douglas Hofstadter lecture where he was counting

the Collatz to see how to get from one number to another.

At the moment I have listed the path of rooms to return to room 1, which means you donâ€™t need to do
The calculation.
I need to make a better explanation of the play.

I am using modulo to place objects in the rooms
